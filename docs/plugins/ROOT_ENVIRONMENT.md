## Chromium Environment

Root.exe is a .NET 10 / Avalonia desktop app that embeds **DotNetBrowser** (a Chromium wrapper) for its web UI. Your plugin code runs inside this Chromium instance.

Key properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Browser engine | DotNetBrowser (Chromium-based) |
| Incognito mode | `--incognito` flag is set |
| Web security | `--disable-web-security` flag is set |
| DevTools | Not available (no access) |
| CORS | Disabled (cross-origin requests work freely) |
| localStorage | Not available (incognito mode) |
| sessionStorage | Available (per-session only) |
| IndexedDB | Not available (incognito mode) |
| Cookies | Session-only (not persisted) |

The `--disable-web-security` flag means you can make fetch requests to any origin without CORS restrictions. The `--incognito` flag means no persistent client-side storage.

---

## Injection Targets

Root's Chromium hosts multiple web contexts. Uprooted's TypeScript layer runs in the **WebRTC context**.

### WebRTC Context (where your plugin runs)

The primary injection target. Contains:
- Voice/video call UI
- Bridge objects (`__nativeToWebRtc`, `__webRtcToNative`)
- Media management (WebRTC peer connections)
- Full DOM access to the call interface

This context is loaded from Root's bundled HTML files. Uprooted's C# hook patches these HTML files to inject the `<script>` tag that loads `uprooted-preload.js`. See [Hook Reference](../HOOK_REFERENCE.md) for details on how the HTML patching works.

### Sub-App Contexts (separate iframes)

Root also embeds 7 React/Vite sub-apps in iframes:
- Polls, Tasks, Raids, Suggestions, Stickers, Hexatris, Minecraft

These run in **separate iframe contexts**. Your plugin cannot directly access their DOM or JS globals. They communicate with the native host via a different bridge (`__rootSdkBridgeWebToNative`), which Uprooted does not proxy.

---

## Sub-App Context Comparison

The different web contexts in Root have different capabilities. This table summarizes what is available in each context.

| Feature | WebRTC Context (plugins) | Sub-App Iframes | Notes |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| `__nativeToWebRtc` | Available (after join) | Not available | Only exists in WebRTC context |
| `__webRtcToNative` | Available (after join) | Not available | Only exists in WebRTC context |
| `__rootSdkBridgeWebToNative` | Not available | Available | Sub-app bridge, not proxied by Uprooted |
| DOM access | Full (own context) | Own iframe only | Cannot cross iframe boundaries |
| Uprooted globals | Available | Not available | `__UPROOTED_SETTINGS__`, `__UPROOTED_VERSION__`, etc. |
| CSS variables (`--color-*`) | Available | Available | Shared across all contexts via Root's theme system |
| `--rootsdk-*` overrides | Effective in own context | Not effective | Overrides only apply to the document where they are set |
| Fetch API | Available (no CORS) | Available (no CORS) | `--disable-web-security` applies globally |
| WebRTC APIs | Full access | Not available | Only the WebRTC context manages peer connections |
| React | Minimal (not a React app) | Full React apps | Sub-apps are React/Vite bundles |

### Implications for Plugin Developers

- **You cannot modify sub-app UI.** The Polls, Tasks, and other iframe-based features are isolated. Your CSS injections and DOM manipulations only affect the WebRTC context.
- **Theme variable overrides are context-scoped.** Setting `--rootsdk-brand-primary` on `:root` in your context does not propagate to iframes. However, Root's own theme system sets `--color-*` variables in all contexts via the native layer.
- **Bridge methods are WebRTC-only.** The 71 methods documented in [BRIDGE_REFERENCE.md](BRIDGE_REFERENCE.md) are only available in the WebRTC context. Sub-apps use a completely different bridge protocol.

---

> **Note:** This document focuses on the browser-side view relevant to plugin development.

## gRPC Backend Overview

Every action a user takes in Root -- sending a message, joining a community, uploading a file, managing roles -- translates to a **gRPC-web** remote procedure call to Root's backend at `api.rootapp.com`. As a plugin author, you do not call gRPC directly. Instead, your plugin interacts with bridge methods (documented in [Bridge Reference](BRIDGE_REFERENCE.md)), and those bridge methods ultimately cause the .NET host or the WebRTC JavaScript layer to issue gRPC-web requests on your behalf. Understanding this plumbing is valuable for debugging, for knowing what data is available, and for anticipating the capabilities and limits of bridge calls.

### What gRPC-Web Means for Plugins

Standard gRPC requires HTTP/2 with features that browsers cannot fully support. gRPC-web is an adaptation that works over standard HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 by encoding trailers in the response body instead of using HTTP/2 trailing headers. Root's embedded Chromium (DotNetBrowser) makes all backend calls using this protocol with `Content-Type: application/grpc-web+proto` and protobuf binary serialization.

From the plugin perspective, the key implications are:

- **Bridge calls are not HTTP calls.** When you call a bridge method like `webRtcToNative.kickPeer()`, the .NET host translates that into a gRPC-web POST to the backend. You never see the HTTP request or the protobuf encoding from your plugin code.
- **Fetch is available for direct calls.** Because Root runs Chromium with `--disable-web-security`, you can technically use `fetch()` to make your own gRPC-web calls to `api.rootapp.com` if you construct the proper framing and protobuf encoding. This is advanced usage and requires understanding the wire format.
- **Responses are binary.** gRPC-web responses are length-prefixed protobuf frames, not JSON. If you intercept network traffic or attempt direct calls, you need a protobuf decoder to make sense of the data.
- **Authentication is automatic.** The bearer token is attached to all gRPC-web requests by Root's networking layer. Plugins do not need to handle authentication for bridge calls. For direct `fetch()` calls, you would need to extract the token from the `initialize()` bridge call (see [Bridge Reference -- initialize](BRIDGE_REFERENCE.md)).

### Service Categories

Root's backend exposes 27 gRPC services with 163 total methods. These group into several broad categories relevant to plugin development:

| Category | Key Services | What They Cover |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Users & Auth** | `UserGrpcService` (31 methods) | Profile management, settings, blocking, friend lists, authentication |
| **Messaging** | `v2.MessageGrpcService` (15 methods), `DirectMessageGrpcService` (6 methods) | Send/receive messages, reactions, pins, search, direct messages |
| **Communities** | `CommunityGrpcService` (11 methods), `CommunityMemberGrpcService` (6 methods), `CommunityRoleGrpcService` (6 methods) | Community CRUD, membership, roles, invitations, bans |
| **Channels** | `ChannelGrpcService` (6 methods), `ChannelGroupGrpcService` (6 methods), `AccessRuleGrpcService` (7 methods) | Channel management, grouping, access control |
| **Files & Assets** | `FileGrpcService` (9 methods), `AssetGrpcService` (3 methods) | File upload, download, search, asset management |
| **Voice/Video** | `WebRtcGrpcService` (12 methods) | Session management, track signaling, media control |
| **Sub-Apps** | `CommunityAppGrpcService` (14 methods), `AppStoreGrpcService` (6 methods) | Sub-app installation, configuration, app store browsing |
| **Notifications** | `NotificationGrpcService` (7 methods) | Push notifications, read state, preferences |

Not all 163 methods are implemented on the backend. Active testing found 32 actually-implemented endpoints. The remaining methods return gRPC status 12 (UNIMPLEMENTED), meaning the client stubs exist but the server-side logic has not been deployed yet.

The full protocol specification -- including wire format, protobuf encoding, UUID format, and per-method documentation -- is tracked internally.

---

## Sub-Application Lifecycle

Root's web UI is not a single monolithic page. It is composed of multiple sub-applications loaded into iframes, plus the WebRTC context where your plugin runs. Understanding how these sub-apps load, navigate, and affect the DOM is important for writing plugins that remain stable as the user moves through the application.

### How Root Loads Sub-Apps

Root uses a **host iframe container** pattern. The file `DotNetBrowser/RootApps/Bundle/Host/index.html` acts as a frame orchestrator. When the user navigates to a feature like Polls or Raid Planner, the host container loads the corresponding sub-app into an iframe. Each sub-app is a self-contained React/Vite bundle (except Stickerwall, which uses Alpine.js and PixiJS) stored in the profile directory under `RootApps/<uuid>/<version>/`.

Seven sub-apps are currently registered:

| Sub-App | Framework | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Polls | React/Vite | Community polling |
| Suggestions | React/Vite | Suggestion board |
| Task Tracker | React/Vite | Task management |
| Raid Planner | React/Vite | Raid scheduling and coordination |
| Hexatris | React/Vite | Tetris-like game |
| Minecraft Easy Setup | React/Vite | Server setup wizard |
| Stickerwall | Alpine.js + PixiJS | Interactive sticker board |

Sub-apps communicate with the native host exclusively through the `__rootSdkBridgeWebToNative` bridge. They do not make direct network requests to the backend. Instead, they serialize protobuf messages and pass them to the bridge's `.send()` method, which the .NET host forwards to the backend via gRPC-web.

The WebRTC context (where your plugin runs) is loaded separately from the sub-app host. It has its own `WebRtcBundle/index.html` and its own bridge objects (`__nativeToWebRtc` and `__webRtcToNative`). Your plugin code does not run inside sub-app iframes.

### Navigation Events Plugins Can Observe

Root's overall navigation model is SPA-like from the user's perspective. The native Avalonia shell provides the persistent sidebar and window chrome, while the DotNetBrowser control swaps content as the user navigates between chat, communities, settings, and other views.

Plugins can observe navigation in several ways:

- **MutationObserver on the DOM.** When Root transitions between views, the DOM structure within the WebRTC context may change. Use `MutationObserver` (via the `observe()` helper in `src/api/dom.ts`) to detect when elements you depend on are added or removed.
- **Bridge call interception.** Certain bridge methods fire during navigation-related events. For example, `setTheme` fires when the user opens settings and changes themes, and `initialize` fires when a voice session begins. See [Bridge Reference](BRIDGE_REFERENCE.md) for the full list.
- **`hashchange` and `popstate` events.** Root uses local file URLs, not traditional web navigation, so these events are not reliably fired. Do not depend on them.

### How Navigation Affects the DOM and Plugin State

When the user navigates between major sections of Root (for example, from a chat channel to the settings page, or from one community to another), the following can happen in the WebRTC context:

1. **DOM subtrees may be removed and recreated.** Root's UI layer can tear down and rebuild portions of the DOM during transitions. If your plugin injected elements into a subtree that gets destroyed, those elements are gone. Your `MutationObserver` should detect the removal and trigger re-injection.

2. **Bridge objects may become undefined.** The `__nativeToWebRtc` and `__webRtcToNative` objects are only populated during active voice sessions. If the user leaves a call, these become `undefined`. Uprooted's bridge proxies handle this transparently -- your patches remain installed and will fire again when the bridges reappear.

3. **CSS variable values may shift.** If the user changes themes during navigation (through settings), the `--color-*` variables update. Your plugin's custom CSS should use these variables rather than hardcoded colors to stay consistent.

4. **Sub-app iframes are created and destroyed.** When the user opens a sub-app (like Polls or Raid Planner), a new iframe is created. When they leave, it may be destroyed. Since your plugin cannot access sub-app iframes anyway, this primarily matters if you are observing the parent DOM structure and notice iframe elements appearing and disappearing.

### When Plugins Need to Re-Initialize After Navigation

Your plugin's `start()` method is called once during Uprooted's initialization. It is not called again when the user navigates. This means your plugin must be resilient to DOM changes on its own. The recommended patterns are:

- **Use `MutationObserver` for DOM-dependent features.** If your plugin injects UI elements, watch for their removal and re-inject. The `observe()` helper in `src/api/dom.ts` simplifies this pattern.
- **Use bridge interception for data-dependent features.** If your plugin needs to react to voice session changes, intercept the `initialize` and related bridge calls rather than polling for bridge object existence.
- **Store state in memory, not the DOM.** Keep your plugin's state in JavaScript variables, not in DOM attributes or data properties that could be lost during a navigation-triggered re-render.
- **Clean up in `stop()` unconditionally.** Your `stop()` method should remove all injected elements, observers, and event listeners regardless of the current navigation state. Do not assume the DOM is in the same state as when `start()` ran.

## DotNetBrowser Binary IPC

Root's .NET host and its embedded Chromium instance communicate through a proprietary binary IPC channel. Understanding this channel helps explain the characteristics of bridge calls that your plugin makes.

### How the .NET Host Talks to Chromium

DotNetBrowser (the Chromium wrapper Root uses) maintains a binary IPC connection between the .NET host process and the Chromium renderer processes. This connection runs over a dynamically assigned localhost TCP port (the port number changes each launch). Four established loopback TCP connections are maintained between the two sides.

This IPC channel is **not** the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Probing the dynamic port with raw TCP, HTTP, WebSocket upgrades, and CDP endpoint requests returns nothing meaningful. The protocol is proprietary to DotNetBrowser.

### Bridge Object Injection

The JavaScript bridge objects (`__nativeToWebRtc`, `__webRtcToNative`, `__rootSdkBridgeWebToNative`) are injected into the Chromium `window` scope by DotNetBrowser's bridge injection mechanism. The .NET host creates C# objects that implement specific interfaces, and DotNetBrowser's runtime marshals calls between JavaScript and C# across the binary IPC channel.

When your plugin calls a bridge method (through Uprooted's proxy), the call path is:

```
Plugin JS code
  --> Uprooted ES6 Proxy (intercept/log/modify)
    --> Original bridge object (JS stub)
      --> DotNetBrowser binary IPC (localhost TCP)
        --> .NET host method implementation
          --> (possibly) gRPC-web call to api.rootapp.com
```

And for native-to-web calls (where the .NET host pushes data to the browser):

```
.NET host code
  --> DotNetBrowser binary IPC (localhost TCP)
    --> Bridge object JS method
      --> Uprooted ES6 Proxy (intercept/log/modify)
        --> Original handler (or plugin override)
```

### IPC Channel Characteristics

The binary IPC channel has characteristics that affect how bridge calls behave from the plugin perspective:

- **Latency.** Bridge calls cross a process boundary via localhost TCP. Round-trip latency is typically sub-millisecond on modern hardware, but it is not zero. Avoid tight loops that make hundreds of bridge calls in rapid succession.
- **Serialization.** Arguments and return values are serialized across the IPC boundary. Complex objects are converted to JSON-compatible representations. Large payloads (such as file data or long message lists) incur serialization overhead proportional to their size.
- **Synchronous appearance, asynchronous reality.** Some bridge methods appear synchronous from JavaScript but involve asynchronous IPC under the hood. DotNetBrowser handles the synchronization, but this means a bridge call that triggers a backend gRPC request will block the JavaScript thread until the .NET host completes the operation and returns the result.
- **Error propagation.** Exceptions thrown in the .NET host during a bridge call may or may not propagate cleanly to JavaScript. Some errors become generic "native error" messages. Your plugin should wrap bridge calls in try-catch blocks and handle failures gracefully.

### What This Means for Plugin Bridge Calls

As a plugin author, the IPC layer is transparent -- you call bridge methods and get results back. But the following practical guidance follows from the IPC architecture:

- **Batch where possible.** If you need multiple pieces of data from the native host, look for a single bridge method that returns all of it rather than making many individual calls.
- **Do not assume instant returns.** A bridge method that triggers a backend API call may take hundreds of milliseconds. Design your UI to handle loading states.
- **The IPC channel is shared.** Root's own code and all Uprooted plugins share the same IPC channel. There is no priority or isolation between bridge callers. Heavy bridge usage by one plugin could theoretically slow down bridge responses for others, though in practice the overhead is negligible for typical plugin workloads.
- **Uprooted's proxy adds minimal overhead.** The ES6 Proxy wrapping adds a few microseconds of JavaScript overhead per call. This is negligible compared to the IPC round-trip time.

## Effects SDK Pipeline

Root integrates the **Effects SDK** (from effectssdk.ai) for real-time audio and video processing during voice and video calls. This SDK runs within the WebRTC context -- the same context where your plugin code executes.

### What the Effects SDK Does

The Effects SDK provides AI-powered processing features:

- **Noise suppression** -- Removes background noise from microphone input using ONNX Runtime compiled to WebAssembly. Three model tiers are available: speed-optimized (7.1 MB), balanced quality (11.2 MB), and high quality (52.8 MB).
- **Background effects** -- Virtual backgrounds and blur for video calls.
- **Audio enhancement** -- Real-time audio filtering and processing.

The SDK loads WASM model files at runtime from `effectssdk.ai` CDN URLs. These models are cached in the browser's Cache API (which works despite `--incognito` mode).

### Processing Architecture

The Effects SDK operates using Web Workers and AudioWorklets within the WebRTC context:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Effects SDK Worker | Exchanges `Float32Array` audio frames with the main thread |
| Noise Gate Worklet | Manages push-to-talk state and talking indicators |
| Native Screen Audio Worklet | Processes screen share audio buffers |

The balanced noise suppression model runs as native WASM (compiled via Emscripten) with direct `HEAPF32` memory access for real-time audio processing.

### Plugin Interaction Considerations

Uprooted does not currently provide an API for interacting with the Effects SDK pipeline. However, plugin authors should be aware of the following:

- **Shared WebRTC context.** The Effects SDK runs in the same JavaScript context as your plugin. Its Web Workers and AudioWorklets are active during voice sessions.
- **Audio stream access.** Plugins that use the Web Audio API (`AudioContext`, `MediaStream`) are working with the same audio streams that the Effects SDK processes. If you create custom audio processing nodes, they may interact with the SDK's pipeline. Test carefully to avoid introducing audio artifacts.
- **CPU and memory impact.** The WASM noise suppression models consume significant CPU and memory during voice sessions. Plugins that perform heavy computation during calls should be mindful of the total resource budget.
- **No direct SDK API.** The Effects SDK does not expose a public JavaScript API that plugins can call. Its configuration is controlled by Root's native layer through bridge calls. If future Uprooted versions expose effects control, it will be through bridge method interception rather than direct SDK calls.

---

## CSS Variable System

Root's entire color system is driven by CSS custom properties. There are two layers:

### Base Variables (`--color-*`)

Set by Root's theme system via `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`. These are the actual values used by CSS rules.

### Override Variables (`--rootsdk-*`)

Each `--color-*` variable is defined using `var(--rootsdk-*, fallback)`, allowing SDK/plugin overrides. Setting a `--rootsdk-*` variable overrides the corresponding `--color-*` value.

**Example:** Root's CSS might define:
```css
--color-brand-primary: var(--rootsdk-brand-primary, #3B6AF8);
```

To override, set `--rootsdk-brand-primary` -- no need to touch `--color-brand-primary` directly.

### Theme Variables (25 per theme)

#### Dark Theme (default)

| Variable | Override | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--color-brand-primary` | `--rootsdk-brand-primary` | `#3B6AF8` | Primary brand blue |
| `--color-brand-secondary` | `--rootsdk-brand-secondary` | `#A8FF5D` | Secondary brand green |
| `--color-brand-tertiary` | `--rootsdk-brand-tertiary` | `#49D6AC` | Tertiary brand teal |
| `--color-text-primary` | `--rootsdk-text-primary` | `#F2F2F2` | Primary text (white) |
| `--color-text-secondary` | `--rootsdk-text-secondary` | `#A7A7A8` | Secondary text (gray) |
| `--color-text-tertiary` | `--rootsdk-text-tertiary` | `#7B7B89` | Tertiary text (dark gray) |
| `--color-text-white` | `--rootsdk-text-white` | `#F2F2F2` | Always-white text |
| `--color-background-primary` | `--rootsdk-background-primary` | `#0D1521` | Main background |
| `--color-background-secondary` | `--rootsdk-background-secondary` | `#121A26` | Secondary background |
| `--color-background-tertiary` | `--rootsdk-background-tertiary` | `#07101B` | Tertiary background |
| `--color-input` | `--rootsdk-input` | `#090E13` | Input field background |
| `--color-border` | `--rootsdk-border` | `#242C36` | Border color |
| `--color-highlight-light` | `--rootsdk-highlight-light` | `#FFFFFF0A` | Light highlight (4%) |
| `--color-highlight-normal` | `--rootsdk-highlight-normal` | `#FFFFFF19` | Normal highlight (10%) |
| `--color-highlight-strong` | `--rootsdk-highlight-strong` | `#FFFFFF30` | Strong highlight (19%) |
| `--color-info` | `--rootsdk-info` | `#F0F250` | Info yellow |
| `--color-warning` | `--rootsdk-warning` | `#E88F3D` | Warning orange |
| `--color-error` | `--rootsdk-error` | `#F03F36` | Error red |
| `--color-muted` | `--rootsdk-muted` | `#4F5C6F` | Muted/disabled color |
| `--color-link` | `--rootsdk-link` | `#88A5FF` | Link color |
| `--color-background-blur` | `--rootsdk-background-blur` | `#00000080` | Blur overlay |
| `--color-self-mention` | `--rootsdk-self-mention` | `#FF2D1F66` | Self-mention highlight |
| `--color-community-mention` | `--rootsdk-community-mention` | `#A8FF5D33` | Community mention |
| `--color-channel-mention` | `--rootsdk-channel-mention` | `#E88F3D4D` | Channel mention |
| `--color-transparent` | `--rootsdk-transparent` | `transparent` | Transparent |

#### Theme Differences

**Light theme** swaps backgrounds to whites/grays (`#FBFBFB`, `#FFFFFF`, `#F5F6F8`), darkens text (`#131313`), and adjusts accent colors to be more saturated for contrast.

**Pure Dark theme** replaces the navy-blue backgrounds with true neutral grays (`#161617`, `#1F1F22`, `#111113`). All other variables are identical to the dark theme.

See the [themes.json](../../src/plugins/themes/themes.json) file for the exact override values used by Uprooted's built-in themes.

## Theme CSS Variable Architecture

This section explains how Root's CSS variable system works end-to-end and how Uprooted's theme plugin interacts with it.

### How Root Sets Theme Variables

1. Root's C# host calls `nativeToWebRtc.setTheme(theme)` when the user changes the theme in settings. This is a bridge call that plugins can intercept (see [Bridge Reference -- setTheme](BRIDGE_REFERENCE.md#setthemetheme)).
2. Root's WebRTC JS layer sets the `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` (e.g. `data-theme="dark"`).
3. Root's CSS uses attribute selectors to apply theme-specific variable values:
   ```css
   [data-theme="dark"] {
     --color-brand-primary: var(--rootsdk-brand-primary, #3B6AF8);
     --color-background-primary: var(--rootsdk-background-primary, #0D1521);
     /* ... */
   }
   ```

### How Uprooted Overrides Variables

Uprooted's theme plugin (`src/plugins/themes/index.ts`) overrides the `--rootsdk-*` variables by setting inline styles on `document.documentElement`:

```typescript
// From src/api/native.ts:19
document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--rootsdk-brand-primary", "#e11d48");
```

This works because CSS specificity rules make inline styles on `:root` take precedence over the stylesheet defaults. Since `--color-brand-primary` is defined as `var(--rootsdk-brand-primary, #3B6AF8)`, setting the override variable changes the computed value of the base variable.

### Custom Theme Generation

The built-in theme plugin can generate a full set of theme variables from just two inputs: an accent color and a background color. The `generateCustomVariables()` function in `src/plugins/themes/index.ts:82` uses color math helpers (`darken`, `lighten`, `luminance`) to derive all 10 override variables:

- Brand primary = accent color
- Brand secondary = accent lightened 15%
- Brand tertiary = accent darkened 15%
- Background primary = background color
- Background secondary = background lightened 8%
- Background tertiary = background darkened 8%
- Input = background darkened 5%
- Border = background lightened 18%
- Link = accent lightened 30%
- Muted = background lightened 25% (dark themes) or darkened 25% (light themes)

### Best Practices for Theme Plugins

- **Always clean up variables in `stop()`.** Call `removeCssVariable()` for every variable you set. The built-in theme plugin tracks all variable names in a Set and iterates it on stop.
- **Flush before applying.** When switching between themes, remove all previous overrides first to avoid stale values. See `src/plugins/themes/index.ts:117`.
- **Use `--rootsdk-*` not `--color-*`.** Setting `--color-*` directly will work but will not be removed cleanly when themes change, because Root resets `--color-*` via its own stylesheet.
- **Consider the `setTheme` bridge call.** When Root changes theme, your overrides may conflict. Intercept `setTheme` to detect theme changes and re-apply or clear your overrides accordingly.

## Window Globals

Objects available on `window` in Root's Chromium context.

### Root Bridges

| Global | Always Present | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| `__nativeToWebRtc` | After join | INativeToWebRtc -- native host controls (proxied by Uprooted) |
| `__webRtcToNative` | After join | IWebRtcToNative -- WebRTC notifications (proxied by Uprooted) |

These are only populated when a voice session is active. They may be `undefined` before the user joins a call.

### Uprooted Globals

| Global | Always Present | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| `__UPROOTED_SETTINGS__` | Yes | Settings object with `enabled`, `plugins`, `customCss` |
| `__UPROOTED_VERSION__` | Yes | Version string (e.g. `"0.2.2"`) |
| `__UPROOTED_LOADER__` | Yes | PluginLoader instance |

### Other Root Globals

Root may also expose additional globals depending on context. These are not part of Uprooted's API and may change without notice:

| Global | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `__rootSdkBridgeWebToNative` | Sub-app bridge (not proxied by Uprooted) |
| Various media/RTC objects | WebRTC peer connections and media managers |

## Available Web APIs

Since you're running in a Chromium context, standard web APIs are available:

### Fully Available
- **DOM API** -- `document.querySelector`, `createElement`, `MutationObserver`, etc.
- **Fetch API** -- `fetch()` with no CORS restrictions
- **WebRTC** -- `RTCPeerConnection`, `MediaStream`, `getUserMedia`
- **MediaDevices** -- `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()`
- **Timers** -- `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`
- **Web Audio** -- `AudioContext`, `GainNode`, analyzers
- **Canvas** -- `<canvas>` rendering, `OffscreenCanvas`
- **Clipboard** -- `navigator.clipboard` (read/write)
- **Notifications** -- `Notification` API (if permitted)
- **WebSocket** -- Full WebSocket support

### Not Available or Restricted
- **localStorage** -- Returns empty / throws (incognito mode)
- **IndexedDB** -- Not available (incognito mode)
- **Service Workers** -- Not registered
- **DevTools** -- No access to Chrome DevTools
- **Extensions** -- No Chrome extension APIs

---

## Debugging Strategies

Without DevTools, debugging requires alternative approaches.

### Error Banner

Uprooted catches fatal initialization errors and displays a red banner at the top of the page:

```
[Uprooted] Fatal: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined...
```

This banner appears automatically for uncaught errors during `main()`. For your own plugin code, you can create similar indicators:

```typescript
start() {
  try {
    // ... your code
  } catch (err) {
    const banner = document.createElement("div");
    banner.style.cssText = "position:fixed;top:0;left:0;right:0;z-index:999999;" +
      "padding:8px 16px;background:#dc2626;color:#fff;font:12px monospace;";
    banner.textContent = `[MyPlugin] Error: ${err}`;
    document.body.appendChild(banner);
  }
}
```

### nativeLog

Send messages to Root's .NET log output:

```typescript
import { nativeLog } from "../api/native.js";

nativeLog("Plugin started");
nativeLog(`Found ${count} elements`);
```

These appear in Root's internal logs with the `[Uprooted]` prefix. The function is defined in `src/api/native.ts:42`.

### DOM Indicators

Create visible DOM elements to show plugin state:

```typescript

### Console Logging

`console.log` works but is only visible if you can attach an external debugger. Useful mainly for structured logging that you can later review if a debugger becomes available.

## Constraints & Gotchas

### No Persistent Storage

Root runs Chromium with `--incognito`. This means:
- `localStorage.getItem()` returns `null`
- `localStorage.setItem()` may silently fail or throw
- IndexedDB is unavailable
- Cookies are session-only

**Workaround:** Use `window.__UPROOTED_SETTINGS__` for configuration. For runtime state, keep it in memory (it resets on restart anyway). For data that must persist across sessions, the only path is through the settings JSON file which Uprooted's C# hook reads at startup.

### Obfuscated CSS Classes

Root's React/Vite sub-apps use CSS modules or similar, producing class names like `_container_a1b2c` that change between versions. Don't rely on these.

**Workaround:** Use data attributes, ARIA attributes, tag structure, or other stable selectors when possible. The WebRTC context is more stable since it's not a Vite bundle.

### React Re-Renders

Root's UI (especially sub-apps) uses React, which can remove and re-create DOM nodes at any time. If you inject elements into a React-managed subtree:
- Your injected nodes may be removed without warning
- Event listeners on React-managed nodes may stop working

**Workaround:** Use `MutationObserver` (via `observe()` in `src/api/dom.ts:44`) to detect when your injected content is removed, and re-inject it. Always clean up observers in `stop()`. See [Getting Started -- Tutorial 5: DOM Injection](GETTING_STARTED.md#tutorial-5-dom-injection) for a full walkthrough.

### Bridge Timing

The bridge objects (`__nativeToWebRtc`, `__webRtcToNative`) are only set when a voice session is active. If your plugin patches bridge methods, the patches are installed at plugin start regardless -- they'll fire when the bridge becomes active.

However, if you need to call bridge methods directly in `start()`, check for their existence first:

```typescript
start() {
  if (window.__webRtcToNative) {
    window.__webRtcToNative.log("Plugin active during voice session");
  }
}
```

### No Module Imports at Runtime

Plugins are bundled into the Uprooted preload script at build time. You cannot use dynamic `import()` at runtime -- there's no module server or filesystem access from the Chromium context.

### Single Context

All plugins share a single JS execution context. This means:
- Global variable pollution is possible -- namespace your globals
- One plugin's uncaught error can affect others
- `window` is shared across all plugins

See [API Reference -- Error Handling](API_REFERENCE.md#error-handling) for how the loader isolates plugin errors, and [API Reference -- Plugin-to-Plugin Communication](API_REFERENCE.md#plugin-to-plugin-communication) for patterns to safely share state between plugins.

### CSS Specificity

Root's own styles may use `!important` or high-specificity selectors. Your injected CSS may need `!important` to override them:

```css
.some-root-element {
  background: #ff0000 !important;
}
```

For CSS variable overrides, use the `--rootsdk-*` pattern instead of trying to override `--color-*` directly -- this is the designed override mechanism.

## Version Compatibility

This table tracks which Uprooted versions have been tested against which Root Communications versions.

| Uprooted Version | Root Version(s) | Status | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 0.1.x | 0.9.86+ | Supported | Current development line |
| 0.1.92+ | 0.9.86 - 0.9.90 | Tested | Verified working |
| 0.2.2 | 0.9.86 - latest | In development | Active development target |

### Compatibility Notes

- **Root updates may break HTML patches.** Root's auto-updater can overwrite the HTML files that Uprooted patches. The C# hook's `HtmlPatchVerifier` (see [Hook Reference](../HOOK_REFERENCE.md)) automatically detects and re-applies patches using a `FileSystemWatcher`.
- **Bridge method signatures are stable.** Root's bridge interfaces (`INativeToWebRtc`, `IWebRtcToNative`) have remained stable across all tested versions. New methods may be added, but existing method signatures have not changed.
- **CSS variable names are stable.** The 25 `--color-*` / `--rootsdk-*` variable pairs have been consistent across all tested Root versions. New variables may be added in future versions.
- **Sub-app iframe structure may change.** The number and type of embedded sub-apps can change between Root versions. Do not rely on specific iframes being present.

### If Something Breaks After a Root Update

1. Check that Uprooted's HTML patches are still applied (look for the `<script>` tag in Root's HTML files)
2. Verify the bridge objects are still being proxied (`window.__nativeToWebRtc` should be a Proxy)
3. Check `nativeLog` output for startup errors
4. If CSS looks wrong, Root may have changed variable names -- compare against the variable table above
